# hello-world
Trying to figure out GitHub
I earned and MIS degree in 1999.  My company promptly outsourced all development jobs to India.  I've taken my career in a different direction the past 18 years.  
Time to get back to my roots.  Refreshing my tech skills at the local technical college.  Purchased Visual Studio.  Wish me luck!
